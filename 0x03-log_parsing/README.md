 By: Alexa Orrico, Software Engineer at Holberton School
 Weight: 1
 Project will start Jan 21, 2024 10:00 PM, must end by Jan 25, 2024 10:00 PM
 Checker was released at Jan 22, 2024 10:00 PM
 An auto review will be launched at the deadline
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Tasks
0. Log parsing
mandatory
Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics:

Input format: <IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size> (if the format is not this one, the line must be skipped)
After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), print these statistics from the beginning:
Total file size: File size: <total size>
where <total size> is the sum of all previous <file size> (see input format above)
Number of lines by status code:
possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500
if a status code doesn’t appear or is not an integer, don’t print anything for this status code
format: <status code>: <number>
status codes should be printed in ascending order
Warning: In this sample, you will have random value - it’s normal to not have the same output as this one.
